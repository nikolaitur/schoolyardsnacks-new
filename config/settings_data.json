The biggest business in the world (Amazon) can‚Äôt even get items out the door without 3+ weeks of wait time. We all understand because it‚Äôs not just businesses that have difficulties, every individual feels it in one way or another.</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Everything in the world has either slowed down or stopped all together.</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>In our scenario, we‚Äôre feeling it in a lot of places. But the one we're sharing with you today is our challenge to find more warehouse space. Finding warehouse space isn‚Äôt easy in a normal world. Sprinkle in a pandemic and things reach a new level of difficult.</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Wondering how this relates to selling out of <b><u><a href=\"https://schoolyardsnacks.com/products/keto-puffs\" target=\"_blank\">Keto Cheese puffs</a></u></b> in days? This is how it relates‚Ä¶.</p>",
          "situtation-content-2": "<p>We‚Äôre out of space.</p>\n<p>Actually, 8 months ago we were out of space. Today, it‚Äôs next level.</p>\n<p>You may look at the photo above and think it‚Äôs a huge warehouse. That‚Äôs a reasonable thing to assume because it is a huge warehouse. And it‚Äôs completely full.</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>There‚Äôs not space for even one more pallet. </p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>A large portion of our days goes towards working with Rob (our Head of Logistics) to help figure out a new way to fit more boxes in our warehouse. Recently, we‚Äôve even started having two full trucks of our snacks sitting outside of the warehouse to create more space. We‚Äôve made it this far, but to be honest, it‚Äôs all just band-aids.</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>And after this last new product release, it‚Äôs obvious the band-aids aren‚Äôt holding.</p>",

After seeing the amount of disappointed people we have said enough is enough. <b>Today</b> we signed an agreement to open 5 additional warehouses across the country! </p>\n\n<p>This is a big step.</p>\n\n<p>Scratch that, huge step.</p>\n\n<p>As owners of a small business during these uncertain times, any risk is scary. But it‚Äôs time. We‚Äôve been pushed out of our comfort zone, but that‚Äôs where we thrive.</p>\n\n<p>It‚Äôll take some time to ramp up, realistically several months. But the plan is there. It won‚Äôt be a quick fix, but it‚Äôs coming. So hang in there. There will still be several months of things selling out faster than they should but we‚Äôre hoping to be much more prepared by the end of the year.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks for hanging in there!</p>\n\n<p>Again, we apologize for the quick sell out.</p>\n\n<p>If you missed out on the <b><u><a href=\"https://schoolyardsnacks.com/products/keto-puffs\" target=\"_blank\">Keto Cheese Puffs</a></u></b> we will try to restock as frequently as possible, so keep coming back to check on availability.

Even though veggie sticks are plain on their own, you can spice them up by making a low carb dip to go along with them. If you‚Äôre low on time, just dip them in some Frank‚Äôs buffalo sauce, which is Keto-friendly too!</span></p>\n<p>¬†</p>\n<h3>10.

Sugar-free jello is a great way to satisfy your sweet tooth. There‚Äôs nothing particularly nutritious about it, but it‚Äôs definitely better than falling off the bandwagon. Add some protein powder into your jello, and you can get a high protein snack out of it too!</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One caution: Most sugar-free jello brands are sweetened with sucralose, a questionable artificial sweetener, so try not to have this on the daily. Alternatively, you can make your own with a natural sugar-free sweetener.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p-10-bottom\"></p>"

Sugar-free jello is a great way to satisfy your sweet tooth. There‚Äôs nothing particularly nutritious about it, but it‚Äôs definitely better than falling off the bandwagon. Add some protein powder into your jello, and you can get a high protein snack out of it too!</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One caution: Most sugar-free jello brands are sweetened with sucralose, a questionable artificial sweetener, so try not to have this on the daily. Alternatively, you can make your own with a natural sugar-free sweetener.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p-10-bottom\"></p>"

We only purchase the highest quality ingredients from reputable suppliers who have the highest quality standards. We tried and tested a number of ingredients during our testing, and in many cases chose the more expensive option in order to provide you with the best possible product.</p><p>3. Finally, we are a smaller company and dont have the scale or resources of big food companies. As we grow and purchase at more scale, we will hopefully be able to pass along those savings to our consumers.</p>"
